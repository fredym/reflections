What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git will create a .git hidden directory with some meta-data in it that
	describes the history of the repository. The initialization is required in
	order to create the required data structure for the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area stores changes that are not part of the repository yet but
	once they are added they cannot be changed as if they were stored in the
	working folder.
