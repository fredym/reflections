When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When I want to share my work to others or simply make it publicly available
	to reference it from other documents or material.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I might be in the middle of some change and an automatic pull might
	interfere with this work in progress.
